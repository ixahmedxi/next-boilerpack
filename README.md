# Next Boilerpack

> An opinionated TypeScript based React Next.js, Redux and ThemeUI boilerplate that ensures type safety and testability

## Motivation

I am a big fan of Next.js and I use it frequently in my daily life of being a programmer but the starting boilerplate is very simple and does not include a lot of must haves like Jest and ESLint. It became time consuming adding everything I needed in each project so I made this boilerplate as a good starting point for any of my future projects and open for use to any other fellow devs :)
