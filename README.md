# Next Boilerpack 🎒

> A Next.js boilerplate with some cool stuff added to it to make starting a new project fast and easy as well as making the development process better. 🥳

## Motivation

Next.js is an amazing framework and I use it on the daily basis but the default boilerplate did not fulfill my needs after some time, it became time consuming to start a new project since it needed me to add lots of things to it like linting and testing. So I decided to create a boilerplate that has all of the features that I like and use to start projects fast and for other people to use it as well if they want to.

## Installing

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/ixahmedxi/next-boilerpack <project-name>
$ cd <project-name>
$ npm install
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the boilerplate can be found [here](https://next-boilerpack.vercel.app/)

## Have Fun

Create something magical and most importantly have fun in the process. I would love it if you [tweet me](https://twitter.com/ixahmedxii) your creations using this boilerplate as your starting point and I will do my best to always keep it up to date.

## Contributions

Contributions are always welcome, if you have a suggestion create an issue and let's discuss it. If you have a fix for a bug submit a PR but make sure that all tests pass before doing so.
